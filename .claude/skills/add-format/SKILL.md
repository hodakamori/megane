# Adding a new file format to megane

A new format is **not done** until it is openable on every host where it makes sense. The Rust core, WASM bindings, and Python bindings only get you the parser — each host has a separate registration point and they drift independently. This checklist mirrors CRITICAL RULE #6 in `CLAUDE.md`.

## When to use this skill

- Adding a new parser to `crates/megane-core/`.
- Exposing an existing core parser through WASM or PyO3 for the first time.
- Reviewing a bug report like "format X works on the webapp but won't open in VSCode / JupyterLab".
- Bumping an existing format's host coverage (e.g. trajectory format that was Standalone-only).

## Registration checklist

Walk every item. Skipping one means the format silently fails on at least one host.

### 1. Core + bindings

- [ ] `crates/megane-core/src/<format>.rs` — parser implementation + unit tests.
- [ ] `crates/megane-core/src/lib.rs` — module export.
- [ ] `crates/megane-wasm/src/lib.rs` — `pub use ... <format>` and `#[wasm_bindgen] pub fn parse_<format>(text|bytes) -> Result<ParseResult, JsError>`.
- [ ] `crates/megane-python/src/lib.rs` — PyO3 `parse_<format>` if you want Python API access.
- [ ] Run `npm run build:wasm` and `maturin develop --release` so downstream code can resolve the new symbol.

### 2. TypeScript parser dispatch (shared by **all** browser hosts)

- [ ] `src/parsers/structure.ts` — add the new export to the `WasmModule` interface, hook it up in the dynamic `import("../../crates/megane-wasm/pkg/megane_wasm.js")` block, and add a `case ".<ext>":` to `getParserForExtension`. (Trajectory formats: `src/parsers/trajectory.ts` instead.)

This is the only file that knows how to dispatch by extension; every host below relies on it.

### 3. Standalone webapp openers

- [ ] `src/components/nodes/LoadStructureNode.tsx` — append `.<ext>` to **both** `STRUCTURE_ACCEPT` (file dialog filter) and `STRUCTURE_EXTS` (drag-drop guard).
- [ ] `src/components/nodes/LoadTrajectoryNode.tsx` — same, if it is a trajectory format.

### 4. JupyterLab labextension

- [ ] `jupyterlab-megane/src/filetypes.ts` — add a new entry to either `STRUCTURE_FILETYPES_TEXT` or `STRUCTURE_FILETYPES_BINARY` (binary needs `fileFormat: "base64"`). The labextension iterates these arrays at activation, so adding the entry is sufficient — no other wiring needed.

### 5. VSCode extension

- [ ] `vscode-megane/package.json` — add `{ "filenamePattern": "*.<ext>" }` to the `megane.structureViewer` `customEditors[0].selector` array.
- [ ] `vscode-megane/package.json` — extend the top-level `description` so the marketplace listing mentions the new format.

### 6. Documentation

- [ ] `docs/docs/platform-support.md` — add a row to the Structure or Trajectory table with the correct symbols (`✓` / `API` / `—`) for every host. **`platform-support.md` is the single source of truth** — don't leave it stale.
- [ ] `README.md` — add a row to the format table near the existing PDB / GRO / … entries.
- [ ] If the format has format-specific quirks (e.g. trajectory needs topology), add a note next to the table.

### 7. Tests + fixtures

- [ ] `tests/fixtures/<sample>.<ext>` — commit a small but realistic fixture.
- [ ] Rust unit test in the new `<format>.rs`.
- [ ] TypeScript test in `src/parsers/__tests__/` if dispatch logic is non-trivial.
- [ ] Optional: add the fixture to an existing E2E spec (e.g. `tests/e2e/format-loading.spec.ts`) so the matrix exercises the new opener on every host. E2E is local-only — re-baseline with `MEGANE_E2E_UPDATE=1` per the `e2e-coverage` skill.

### 8. Verification

- [ ] `cargo test -p megane-core`
- [ ] `npm run build:wasm && npm test`
- [ ] `npm run build` (catches Vite, JupyterLab, and webview bundle issues at once)
- [ ] Manual smoke test: open the new fixture from the webapp file dialog **and** from at least one host extension (JupyterLab file browser or VSCode explorer) before declaring done.

## Common omissions caught by this checklist

| Symptom | Missing step |
|---|---|
| Format works on webapp but VSCode shows "no editor" | §5 — `customEditors` selector |
| Format silently rejected by drag-drop in webapp | §3 — `STRUCTURE_EXTS` (different from `STRUCTURE_ACCEPT`) |
| Double-click in JupyterLab opens it as plain text | §4 — `filetypes.ts` registration |
| `parseStructureText` falls back to PDB and produces garbage | §2 — `getParserForExtension` switch case |
| `platform-support.md` claims `✓` but the host can't open it | §6 — table not updated alongside code |

## Source-of-truth pointers

These match CLAUDE.md CRITICAL RULE #6:

- Browser parsers: `crates/megane-wasm/src/lib.rs`
- Standalone accept lists: `src/components/nodes/LoadStructureNode.tsx`, `src/components/nodes/LoadTrajectoryNode.tsx`
- JupyterLab filetypes: `jupyterlab-megane/src/filetypes.ts`
- VSCode customEditors: `vscode-megane/package.json`
- Cross-host status: `docs/docs/platform-support.md`
